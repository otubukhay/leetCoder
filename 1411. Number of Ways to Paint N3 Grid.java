        Classic dynamic programming problem.
        Explanation
        Two pattern for each row, 121 and 123.
        121, the first color same as the third in a row.
        123, one row has three different colors.

        We consider the state of the first row,
        pattern 121: 121, 131, 212, 232, 313, 323.
        pattern 123: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
        So we initialize a121 = 6, a123 = 6.

        We consider the next possible for each pattern:
        Patter 121 can be followed by: 212, 213, 232, 312, 313
        Patter 123 can be followed by: 212, 231, 312, 232

        121 => three 121, two 123
        123 => two 121, two 123

        So we can write this dynamic programming transform equation:
        b121 = a121 * 3 + a123 * 2
        b123 = a121 * 2 + a123 * 2

        We calculate the result iteratively
        and finally return the sum of both pattern a121 + a123


        Complexity
        Time O(N), Space O(1)
        Of course, we can do better.
        O(logN) Time Solution

        Well, I don't think it's required,
        But still you can mention during interview,
        (as a ciper code hinting that you are my follower).
